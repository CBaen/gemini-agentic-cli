# L15: Research Synthesis Patterns

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: done

## Overview
Patterns for synthesizing research from multiple sources in Qdrant.

## Problem
- Research on a topic may span multiple chunks/perspectives
- Need to combine findings coherently
- Avoid returning duplicate information

## Tasks
- [x] Document synthesis patterns
- [x] Define multi-chunk retrieval approach
- [x] Create synthesis workflow

## Results

### Synthesis Patterns

**Pattern 1: Parent-Child Traversal**
```bash
# Get summary (parent)
python ~/.claude/scripts/qdrant-peek.py peek -c lineage_research -q "topic" -l 1

# Use parent_id to get all children
python ~/.claude/scripts/qdrant-peek.py fetch -c lineage_research --ids "child_id1,child_id2"
```

**Pattern 2: Multi-Perspective Combination**
```bash
# Search for all perspectives on a topic
python ~/.claude/scripts/qdrant-semantic-search.py --collection lineage_research --query "topic" --limit 10 --json

# Filter by perspective field
# Combine: architecture + implementation + security perspectives
```

**Pattern 3: Gap-Aware Synthesis**
```
1. Retrieve existing research
2. Identify covered topics (from keywords, questions_answered)
3. Identify gaps
4. Fill gaps with targeted research (L04 pattern)
5. Combine all into coherent summary
```

### Synthesis Workflow

```
Topic Query
    ↓
Search Qdrant (limit=10)
    ↓
Group by perspective
    ↓
For each perspective:
    - Extract key points
    - Note unique insights
    ↓
Combine:
    - Core concepts (all perspectives agree)
    - Implementation details (specific perspective)
    - Edge cases (advanced perspective)
    ↓
Output synthesized summary
```

### Already Implemented

- **lineage-retrieve skill**: Haiku proxy synthesizes multiple chunks
- **L05 validation**: Ensures actionable details preserved
- **Parent-child linking**: All chunks have parent_id for traversal

## Handoff
Complete. Synthesis patterns documented. Use lineage-retrieve with Haiku proxy for automatic synthesis.
