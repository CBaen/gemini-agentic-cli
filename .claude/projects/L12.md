# L12: Decay Rate Tuning

**Priority**: Low
**Status**: done

## Overview
Tuning how stored knowledge "decays" or loses relevance over time.

## Problem
- Old research may become stale
- No clear policy for refreshing outdated content
- Timestamps exist but aren't used for relevance scoring

## Tasks
- [x] Define decay considerations
- [x] Document timestamp-based relevance patterns
- [x] Identify when refresh is needed

## Results

### Current State

**Timestamps stored in Qdrant:**
- `timestamp` field on all points
- Can filter by age if needed

**No automatic decay** - This is intentional:
- Foundational knowledge doesn't decay (OAuth concepts)
- Implementation details may change (library versions)
- Manual refresh preferred over automatic expiration

### Decay Considerations

**Content that DOES decay:**
- Library version specifics
- API documentation details
- Best practices (evolve over time)

**Content that DOESN'T decay:**
- Core concepts (how OAuth works)
- Architecture patterns
- Mathematical/algorithmic knowledge

### Refresh Pattern

**When to refresh:**
1. User explicitly requests updated information
2. Implementation fails due to outdated info
3. Major version changes in dependencies

**How to refresh:**
```bash
# Check timestamp of existing research
python ~/.claude/scripts/qdrant-semantic-search.py --collection lineage_research --query "topic" --limit 1 --json | jq '.[0].payload.timestamp'

# If stale (>30 days for implementation details), re-research with lineage-research
```

### Recommendation

Don't implement automatic decay. Instead:
- Trust timestamps for manual decisions
- Refresh on demand when issues arise
- Keep foundational knowledge indefinitely

## Handoff
Complete. Decay is handled manually. Timestamps available for age checking. No automatic expiration recommended.
