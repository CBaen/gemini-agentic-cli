# L16: Session Continuity Patterns

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: done

## Overview
Patterns for maintaining continuity across Claude sessions.

## Problem
- Each session starts fresh
- Previous session's context is lost
- Need to quickly restore working state

## Tasks
- [x] Document session start protocol
- [x] Define state persistence patterns
- [x] Create session continuity checklist

## Results

### Session Start Protocol

**Step 1: Read Handoff**
```bash
cat <project>/.claude/HANDOFF.md
```
Understand what the previous instance was doing.

**Step 2: Read Memory**
```bash
cat <project>/.claude/MEMORY.md
```
Understand accumulated decisions and gotchas.

**Step 3: Check Qdrant for Context**
```bash
python ~/.claude/scripts/qdrant-peek.py peek -c lineage_research -q "recent work [project]" -l 3
```
Find relevant stored research.

**Step 4: Run Reproduction Commands**
From HANDOFF.md, run any commands to restore state.

### State Persistence Patterns

| State Type | Where Stored | How to Restore |
|------------|--------------|----------------|
| Decisions | MEMORY.md | Read file |
| Work state | HANDOFF.md | Read file + run commands |
| Research | Qdrant | Search by topic/session |
| Code state | Git | `git status`, `git log` |
| Todos | TodoWrite | Auto-loaded |

### Session Continuity Checklist

**Before leaving:**
- [ ] Update HANDOFF.md with current state
- [ ] Commit any code changes (if appropriate)
- [ ] Store important findings to Qdrant
- [ ] Note reproduction commands

**When starting:**
- [ ] Read HANDOFF.md
- [ ] Check git status
- [ ] Query Qdrant for recent session
- [ ] Create initial todo

### Already Implemented

- **session-start skill**: Full orientation workflow
- **handoff skill**: Structured departure
- **CLAUDE.md**: Session lifecycle documentation
- **Qdrant session field**: Track research by session name

## Handoff
Complete. Session continuity handled by HANDOFF.md, MEMORY.md, Qdrant, and skills.
