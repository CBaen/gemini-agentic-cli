# L11: Handoff Protocol Optimization

**Priority**: Medium
**Status**: done

## Overview
Optimize handoff protocol between Claude instances for continuity.

## Problem
- Handoffs can lose important context
- Next instance may not know what was being worked on
- Reproduction commands often missing

## Tasks
- [x] Document handoff best practices
- [x] Define required handoff sections
- [x] Create handoff template

## Results

### Handoff Protocol (Already in CLAUDE.md)

**Required Sections in HANDOFF.md:**
1. **Current State** - What was being worked on
2. **Key Decisions** - Why certain approaches were chosen
3. **What's Working** - Confirmed functionality
4. **What's Broken** - Known issues
5. **Next Steps** - What to do next
6. **Reproduction Commands** - How to get back to this state

### Handoff Template

```markdown
# Handoff - [Date]

## Current State
[Brief description of work in progress]

## Key Decisions
- Decision 1: [rationale]
- Decision 2: [rationale]

## What's Working
- Feature A: [how to verify]
- Feature B: [how to verify]

## What's Broken / Blocked
- Issue 1: [description]

## Next Steps
1. [First priority]
2. [Second priority]

## Reproduction Commands
```bash
# Get to current state
cd [project]
git status
[other commands]
```

## Notes for Next Instance
[Anything the next instance should know]

---
Signed: [Name] - [Date]
```

### Handoff Skill

The `handoff` skill in `~/.claude/skills/` automates this process.
