Okay, I understand the goal is to compare embedding models suitable for the existing hardware (4GB VRAM) to improve embedding latency while maintaining reasonable quality for the "Lineage" system. A JSON output containing the comparison data, GPU usage verification, quantization options, API fallback strategies, and a final recommendation is required.

I will perform web searches to gather information on embedding models, their VRAM requirements, latency, and quantization options. I will also research how to check GPU usage in Ollama and how to configure Ollama to use the GPU. Based on the findings, I'll suggest a primary model and migration steps.
