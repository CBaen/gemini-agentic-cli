Okay, I will start with the ideation phase, researching how Gemini can enhance RSI/MACD signal generation and what patterns can be discovered in multi-stock analysis. I'll use Google Web Search to gather information on advanced techniques for RSI/MACD analysis and pattern recognition using AI.
The web search results provide a solid foundation for enhancing RSI/MACD analysis with AI. Key takeaways include:

*   **Data Acquisition:** Gathering historical stock data (OHLCV) from multiple sources like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, etc., is crucial.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Combining RSI and MACD with other indicators like Bollinger Bands, EMAs, ATR, and Stochastic Oscillator can provide more reliable signals. Libraries like `TA-Lib` are useful for efficient calculation.
*   **AI Pattern Recognition:** CNNs for visual chart patterns, LSTMs for time series analysis, and Reinforcement Learning for automated trading. Ensemble methods can improve accuracy.
*   **Multi-Stock Analysis:** Training models on diverse stocks for generalization and building a scalable system for real-time analysis.
*   **Backtesting:** Rigorous testing on historical data to evaluate performance and risk.

Now, let's delve deeper into how Gemini can specifically improve the RSI/MACD component. I will use Google Web Search to research how large language models can be leveraged for financial time series analysis and sentiment analysis.
The search results highlight the potential of LLMs in financial analysis:

*   **Sentiment Analysis:** LLMs can extract sentiment from news, reports, and social media, providing insights into investor confidence and market trends. FinGPT and FinLlama are specialized models for finance.
*   **Integration with Time Series:** Sentiment scores can be integrated as non-numeric features in time series analysis, correlating sentiment with price movements.
*   **Applications:** Predictive analytics, risk assessment, automated reporting, and customer interaction.
*   **Challenges:** Data quality, domain specificity, accuracy, interpretability, computational costs, and regulatory compliance.

Based on this research, here's a plan for enhancing the RSI/MACD component with Gemini:

1.  **Sentiment-Enhanced Signals:** Incorporate sentiment analysis of financial news articles related to the stocks being analyzed. Use Gemini to extract sentiment scores and integrate them into the RSI/MACD calculations.
2.  **Pattern Recognition with Gemini:** Train Gemini on historical stock data and RSI/MACD patterns to identify potential buy/sell signals that are not apparent through traditional technical analysis.
3.  **Dynamic Parameter Optimization:** Use Gemini to dynamically adjust the RSI and MACD parameters (periods, moving average types) based on market conditions and stock-specific characteristics.
4.  **Prompt Engineering:** Create effective prompts for Gemini to analyze the data and generate trading signals.

I will now refine the todo list to reflect these ideas and mark the ideation phase as completed.
Now I will move on to the integration phase. First, I need to examine the existing `trading/technical/indicators.py` file to understand the current implementation of RSI and MACD.
Error executing tool read_file: File not found: C:\Users\baenb\AppData\Local\Temp\midge_theses\trading\technical\indicators.py
I apologize, it appears I made an assumption about the file path. I need to determine the correct location of the `indicators.py` file. I will use the `glob` tool to search for it within the current working directory.
Okay, it seems the `indicators.py` file is not within the current working directory or its subdirectories. Since the user mentioned that MIDGE uses this file, it's likely located elsewhere in the project. I will delegate this task to the codebase investigator to find the correct file path.
The codebase investigator timed out and was unable to locate the `indicators.py` file. This is unexpected, as the user stated that MIDGE uses this file. I will ask the user to provide the correct file path. Since I cannot interact with the user, I will have to stop here.
